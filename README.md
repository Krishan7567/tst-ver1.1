# Git commands that we will use
....

git clone url       (will clone/download the whole repo)
git add. / fiel     (git will start tracing the changes and moves the files to staging area)
git commit -m "Msg" (Commiting the changes to local repository)
git push            (pushes te changes to remote repository/GitHub)
git pull            (pull the changes from repo since the last clone)

....

I've cloned the repository and have added few changes or files and I'd like to push the changes back to GitHub repo.

# Here is the flow to follow

1) Clone the repo using 'git clone'
2) Open the repo in VS Code/Editor, do the changes
3) git add . ; git commit -m "Msg telling what you've done" ; git push
4) Changes that you have made are pushed
5) On your server, do a git clone URL the first time and from second time to test, just do a 'git pull'

this is the way how it works..!!
